• Basement apartment
C
Year_of_Construction

D
TypeofRating
Ratings Type
There are 3 types of BER Certificate: • “New Dwelling – Provisional BER”: required for a dwelling that is not yet built but is offered for sale “off the plans”. If a dwelling is not offered for sale at this stage then this certificate is not required. This certificate is valid for 2 years from the date of issue or until the dwelling is finished, whichever is shorter. It is based on the architectural drawings and specifications of the proposed dwelling. Once construction is finished a “New Dwelling – Final” certificate is required. • “New Dwelling – Final BER”: required for a newly-built dwelling before it is occupied, regardless of whether the dwelling has a “New Dwelling – Provisional BER”. This certificate is based on data collected in a site survey carried out by a registered BER Assessor as well as drawings & specifications for the completed dwelling. It is valid for 10 years from the date of issue though it becomes invalid if material changes are made to the dwelling during that period. • “Existing Dwelling BER”: required for any existing dwelling that is offered for sale or to let. An existing dwelling is one that has previously been sold or occupied. This is based on data collected in a site survey carried out by a registered BER Assessor. It is valid for 10 years from the date of issue though it becomes invalid if material changes are made to the dwelling during that period.
E
EnergyRating
Energy Rating Category
The BER scale is divided into categories from G (largest primary energy usage) to an A1 rating (lowest primary energy usage). The full range of categories is described in Table 2 of the Appendix.
F
BerRating
Energy Rating
The Building Energy Rating of the dwelling, i.e. the total Primary Energy Use for the dwelling expressed in units of kWh/m2/year. A low BER indicates an energy efficient dwelling. It is critical to note that multiple factors including dwelling dimensions, orientation, ventilation, dwelling fabric, water heating, lighting, space heating, heating controls and fuel type influence the building energy rating and must all be considered when determining the actual rating and where potential improvements could be made.
G
GroundFloorArea(sq m)
Ground Floor Area
Any floor separating the dwelling from another heated dwelling, e.g. the floor in a mid-floor apartment that is situated directly over another apartment, is assumed to have no heat loss so it is not included here.
H

Average Wall U-value
The average U-value of all exposed and semi-exposed walls in the dwelling. For the purposes of comparison, the 2019 Building Regulations Part L specifies a maximum wall U-value of 0.18 W/m2K though higher values can be expected in older dwellings.
I
UValueRoof
Average Roof U-value
The average U-value of all exposed and semi-exposed roofs in the dwelling. For the purposes of comparison, the 2019 Building Regulations Part L specifies a maximum U-value of 0.16 W/m2K for a pitched roof insulated at the joists, though higher values can be expected in older dwellings.
J
UValueFloor
Average Floor U-value
The average U-value of all exposed and semi-exposed floors in the dwelling. For the purposes of comparison, the 2019 Building Regulations Part L specifies a maximum floor U-value of 0.18 W/m2K though higher values can be expected in older dwellings.
K
UValueWindow
Average Window U-value
The average U-value of all windows in the dwelling. The U-value is for the whole window: glazing and frame. For the purposes of comparison, the 2019 Building Regulations Part L specifies a maximum U-value of 1.4 W/m2K for windows, though this can vary depending on the amount of glazing.
L
UvalueDoor
Average Door U-value
The average U-value of all doors in the dwelling.
M
WallArea
Exposed Wall Area
The total area of exposed and semi-exposed walls in the dwelling. Any wall separating the dwelling from another heated dwelling, e.g. the party wall in a semi-detached house, is assumed to have no heat loss so it is not included here.
N
RoofArea
Exposed Roof Area
The total area of exposed and semi-exposed roofs in the dwelling. The area is measured at the thermal envelope which is where the insulation is located. In a typical Irish house with a pitched roof and insulation laid between (and possibly above) the ceiling joists, the ceiling area is the relevant measurement.

• 2019
Y
MPCDERValue
MPCDER Value
The Maximum Permitted Carbon Dioxide Emission Rating value. This is the maximum amount of carbon dioxide allowed to be emitted by a new dwelling according to the Building Regulations, Part L. The MPCDER is calculated by DEAP, based on a reference house of the same dimensions as the dwelling being tested. If the CO2 Emissions of the dwelling (see Row G) is greater than the MPCDER value then the dwelling does not comply with Part L. This only applies to New Dwellings built according to the 2005 edition of the Building Regulations, Part L.
Z
HSEffAdjFactor
Main SH Efficiency Adjustment
This is an adjustment to the efficiency of the main heating system which may be applied depending on the type of heating system and other factors such as heating controls or the type of distribution system. The default value is 1. Alternative values are taken from Table 4c of the DEAP manual.
AA
HSSupplHeatFraction
Secondary SH Fraction
The fraction of the space heating load that is provided by the secondary space heating system. A secondary space heating system is specified if: • fixed secondary heaters are present, e.g. an open fire, or, • the main heating system is insufficient to heat the dwelling to the temperatures required. If there is no secondary system specified this has a value of zero. Otherwise the value depends on the type of the main space heating system and the type of the secondary space heating system and is taken from DEAP manual Table 7.
AB

Secondary SH Efficiency
The (gross) seasonal efficiency of the secondary space heating system, if one is present. The efficiency may be taken from one of three sources: • the HARP database, • a manufacturer’s value certified by an accredited testing laboratory, or, • a default value from DEAP manual Table 4a/4b may be used. If there is no secondary system then this field will have a value of zero. Otherwise it will have a value between 0 and 100 with a high value indicating an efficient heating system.
AC
WHMainSystemEff
Main WH Efficiency
The (gross) seasonal efficiency of the main water heating system. The efficiency may be taken from one of three sources: • the HARP database, • a manufacturer’s value certified by an accredited testing laboratory, or, • a default value from DEAP manual Table 4a/4b may be used.
AD
WHEffAdjFactor
Main WH Efficiency Adjustment

Secondary SH Fuel
The fuel used by the secondary space heating system, if present (see Column Y). Fuel data is taken from DEAP manual Table 8.
AF
SupplWHFuel
Secondary WH Fuel
The fuel used by the supplementary water heating system, if one is required. Currently there is only one type of supplementary water heating system recognised in the BER, namely the immersion heater located in the hot water cylinder, so the fuel in question, if specified, is always ‘Electricity’.
AG
SHRenewableResources
SH Renewables
Do renewable sources meet the main space heating need? Allowed values: • No • Yes – Solar • Yes – Woodchip or Wood Pellet • Yes – Heat Pump • Yes – Other This is used in the MPCDER calculation for houses built according to the Building Regulations Part L, 2005.
AH

AI
NoOfChimneys
No. of chimneys
The number of chimneys in the dwelling. A chimney is defined as a vertical duct for combustion gases of diameter 200 mm or more. In DEAP a chimney contributes 40 m3/hour to the ventilation rate of the dwelling.
AJ
NoOfOpenFlues
No. of open flues.
The number of open flues in the dwelling. An open flue is defined as a vertical duct for combustion gases of diameter less than 200 mm. In addition, a chimney with a restricted airflow – e.g., a chimney with a flexible flue liner, a chimney with a damper, a stove with its outlet flue sealed to the chimney – is considered to be an open flue. In DEAP an open flue contributes 20 m3/hour to the ventilation rate of the dwelling.
AK
NoOfFansAndVents
No. of fans and vents.
The number of intermittent fans - e.g., automatic extract fans in toilets, the extract fan in a cooker hood – and permanent vents in the dwelling. Only vents with a permanently open area greater than 3500mm2 are counted. Vents which can be closed to less than 3500mm2, e.g. by a sliding mechanism, are not counted. In DEAP an intermittent fan or a permanent vent contributes 10 m3/hour to the ventilation rate of the dwelling.
AL
NoOfFluelessGasFires
No. fixed flueless gas fires.
The number of fixed flueless gas fires in the dwelling. Portable flueless gas fires are not counted. In DEAP a flueless gas fire contributes 40 m3/hour to the ventilation rate of the dwelling.
AM
DraftLobby
Draft lobby
Is there a draft lobby? Allowed Values: Yes or No. This specifies if the house has a draft lobby on the main entrance to the dwelling. A draught lobby is an arrangement of two doors that forms an airlock to the dwelling, sized such that a person with a pushchair or similar can close the outer door before opening the inner door. The draft lobby acts as an airlock which reduces the amount of warm air lost from the dwelling when the main entrance door is opened.
AN
VentilationMethod
Ventilation
The main type of ventilation system used in the house: • Natural ventilation • Positive input ventilation from loft • Positive input ventilation from outside • Whole-house extract ventilation • Balanced whole-house mechanical ventilation, no heat recovery • Balanced whole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery • Exhaust air heat pump
Natural Ventilation is by far the most common in Irish dwellings though mechanical ventilation, in particular ‘balanced whole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery’ is becoming more common.
AO
FanPowerManuDeclaredValue
Mech. Vent. SFP
The specific fan power of the mechanical ventilation system. If there is no mechanical ventilation system this has a value of 0. If a mechanical ventilation system is present a default value of 2 W/[l/s] is assumed unless an appropriately-certified manufacturer’s declared value is provided.
AP
HeatExchangerEff
HR Efficiency
The efficiency of the heat recovery unit in a balanced whole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery system. If there is no heat recovery unit this has a value of 0. If such a system is present a default value of 66% is assumed unless an appropriately-certified manufacturer’s declared value is provided.
AQ
StructureType
Wall Structure
The structural make-up of the walls of the house. There are 3 possible values: • Masonry, • Timber or Steel-frame, • Insulated Concrete Form. This information is used to estimate the amount of air leakage through cracks in the walls of the dwelling which is necessary if an air permeability test has not been performed on the dwelling. Air leakage through masonry walls contributes 0.35 ac/h to the ventilation rate whereas timber/steel-frame and ICF walls have an assumed leakage rate of 0.25 ac/h.
AR
SuspendedWoodenFloor
Susp. Wood Floor
Is there a suspended wooden floor? There are 3 possible values: • No, which means there is a solid floor; • Yes (Sealed), which means there is a suspended timber floor sealed at the edges and between the floorboards. • Yes (Unsealed), which means there is a suspended timber floor which is not sealed at the edges or between the floorboards. This information is used to estimate the amount of air leakage through the floor of the dwelling which is necessary if an air permeability test has not been performed on the dwelling. Air leakage through a solid floor is taken to be zero. A sealed suspended wooden floor has a leakage rate of 0.1 ac/h and an unsealed suspended wooden floor has a leakage rate of 0.2 ac/h.
AS
PercentageDraughtStripped
Percentage draught-stripping
The percentage of openings (windows, doors and attic-hatches) in the dwelling that have draught-stripping. Any whole number from 0 and 100% is allowed. In New Dwellings a value of 100% is assumed. In Existing Dwellings this number is calculated from survey data. It is assumed that double- or triple-glazed windows are draught-stripped.
AT
NoOfSidesSheltered
No. Sheltered Sides
The number of sides of the dwelling receiving shelter from nearby obstacles such as neighbouring buildings or trees. Allowed values: 0 – 4. This information is determined by site survey. Obstacles must be sufficiently high, wide and near to the dwelling to be considered to offer shelter to a side of the dwelling.
AU
PermeabilityTest
Perm. Test
Has an air permeability test been performed on the dwelling? Allowed values: Yes or No. An air permeability test (see Glossary) is used to determine the amount of air leakage through the structure of the dwelling under normal conditions. Most existing dwellings will not have had this test done though it is now a requirement for new dwellings.
AV
PermeabilityTestResult
Perm. Test Result
The result of the pressurisation test expressed in units of ac/h (see Glossary). If no test has been performed on the dwelling a value of 0 is used. For the purposes of comparison, the 2019 Building Regulations Part L specifies a maximum value of 0.25 ac/h though higher values can be expected in older dwellings.
AW
TempAdjustment
Temperature Adjustment
This is an adjustment to the “mean internal temperature during heating hours” used to account for very poor or very good levels of control of the main heating system. For most systems it is zero. For systems with poor control, e.g. an oil boiler & radiators with no room thermostats and no programmer, it has a positive value thereby increasing the internal temperature of the dwelling. This requires more fuel to be used which will increase the BER. A negative temperature adjustment is also possible, e.g. a delayed-start thermostat has a temperature adjustment of -0.15°C, which will reduce fuel use and reduce the BER.
AX
HeatSystemControlCat
Control Cat.
The controls on the main space heating system are assigned a control category depending on whether they offer poor, good or ideal control. Allowed values: 1 – 3. Control Category Control Level 1 Poor control 2 Good control 3 Ideal control A control category of 1 or 2 will increase the internal temperature in the dwelling. This requires more fuel to be used which will increase the BER. Control Category values are taken from DEAP manual Table 4e.
AY
HeatSystemResponseCat
Responsiveness Cat.
The Heating System Responsiveness category is a measure of how well the heating distribution system responds to a change of the control input. Allowed values: 1 – 5. Systems which respond quickly, e.g. radiators, have a low responsiveness category. Systems which respond slowly, e.g. underfloor heating where the pipes are embedded in concrete slab, have a high responsiveness category. A low responsiveness category will lead to a better BER.
AZ
NoCentralHeatingPumps
No. C.H. Pumps
The number of circulating pumps on the central heating system. Allowed values: 0, 1, 2,…
BA
CHBoilerThermostatControlled
Boiler Stat1
Is the boiler controlled by a room thermostat? Allowed values: Yes or No. This relates to the amount of energy used by the circulating pump(s) on the central heating system. If the boiler is controlled by a room thermostat the pumps will run less and therefore consume less electricity.
BB
NoOilBoilerHeatingPumps
No. Oil Pumps
The number of oil boiler pumps. Allowed values: 0, 1, 2,… In the absence of an oil boiler this is zero.
BC
OBBoilerThermostatControlled
Boiler Stat2
Is the boiler controlled by a room thermostat? Allowed values: Yes or No. This relates to the amount of energy used by the oil boiler pump(s). If the boiler is controlled by a room thermostat the pumps will be running less and therefore consume less electricity.
BD
OBPumpInsideDwelling
Oil Pump In
Is the oil boiler pump inside the dwelling? Allowed values: Yes or no. An oil boiler pump gives out heat when in use and if the pump is inside the dwelling, this heat makes a contribution to the space heat requirement of the dwelling. If the pump is outside the dwelling it does not contribute to the space heating.
BE
NoGasBoilerHeatingPumps
No. Gas Fans
The number of gas boiler flue fans. Allowed values: 0, 1, 2, …. Some gas boilers have a fan in the flue to increase the throughput of air (going in) and exhaust gases (coming out) which makes the combustion process more efficient. In the absence of data to the contrary it is assumed that a gas boiler has one flue fan. If there is no gas boiler in the dwelling then this field is set to zero.
BF
WarmAirHeatingSystem
Warm Air
Is there a Warm-air heating system present? Allowed values: Yes or No. A warm-air heating system is one where space heating is provided by warm air delivered to rooms via a system of ducts.
BG
UndergroundHeating
Underfloor
Is there an underfloor heating system present? Allowed values: Yes or No. This option is no longer used in DEAP.
BH
GroundFloorUValue
Ground Floor U
The U-value of the ground floor of the dwelling. This value is only stated when there is an underfloor heating system present, otherwise it is zero. This option is no longer used in DEAP.
BI
DistributionLosses
Distribution Loss
Distribution Loss: the amount of energy lost transferring hot water to the taps. This is calculated by the software from the total floor area of the dwelling. In any system in which hot water is transferred from a central storage vessel to the taps - e.g. water heated by a regular boiler and stored in a hot water cylinder - the hot water will inevitably lose some heat as it travels through the pipes to the taps. Systems in which water is only heated at the point of use - e.g. a system of instantaneous electric under-sink heaters - do not have any distribution losses. For most Irish dwellings the distribution loss has a value between 200 - 500 kWh/year.
BJ
StorageLosses
Storage Loss
Storage Loss: the amount of energy lost storing hot water. Allowed values: Yes or No. Many HW systems heat water and store it for use at a later time, e.g. the regular-boiler & hot water cylinder system common in Irish dwellings. The hot water cylinder stores the water at a high temperature, typically around 60°C, so it is inevitable that some of this heat will be lost to the cooler surroundings, though the rate of heat loss can be reduced by insulating the cylinder. In DEAP the storage loss depends on the type of hot water store, the volume of the store and the amount and type of insulation. For systems with no storage vessel, e.g. instantaneous combi boilers, storage losses are zero. Depending on the system installed storage losses can range from 0 to several thousand kWh/year.
BK
ManuLossFactorAvail
Declared Loss
Is the Manufacturer’s Declared Loss Factor available for the HW store? Allowed Values: Yes or No. The declared loss factor of the hot water store may be used if it is known. Otherwise the storage losses must be calculated using the type of hot water store, the volume of the store and the amount and type of insulation.
BL
SolarHotWaterHeating
SolarHotWaterHeating
Is there a solar hot water heating system? Allowed values: Yes or No. Set to true if there is a solar water heating system specified in the BER assessment.
BM
ElecImmersionInSummer
Electric Immersion in Summer
Is supplementary electric water heating used in summer? Allowed values: Yes or No. Supplementary electric water heating is specified where the main water heater is incapable of providing water heating without space heating, e.g. in a dwelling with an open fire and back boiler as the main water heating system, it is assumed that the occupant would use the immersion to heat the water in summer rather than light a fire. If set to “Yes” DEAP assumes that 33% of the water heating demand is provided by electricity and that the main water heating system provides the rest.
BN
CombiBoiler
Combi
This indicates the type of combi boiler present, if any; Allowed values are: • None, • Instantaneous, without keep-hot facility, • Instantaneous, with keep-hot facility controlled by time clock, • Instantaneous, with keep-hot facility not controlled by time clock, • Storage combi boiler: store volume ≥ 55 litres, • Storage combi boiler: store volume < 55 litres. An instantaneous combi boiler is one with a store volume less than 15 litres.
BO
KeepHotFacility
Keep Hot
This indicates the type of Keep-hot facility present, if any. Allowed values are: • None • keep-hot facility, controlled by time clock • keep-hot facility, not controlled by time clock This is a facility within an instantaneous combination boiler whereby water within the boiler may be kept hot while there is no demand. The water is kept hot either (i) solely by burning fuel, or (ii) by electricity, or (iii) both by burning fuel and by electricity, though not necessarily simultaneously.
BP
WaterStorageVolume
Water Storage Volume
The volume of the hot water store in litres.
BQ
DeclaredLossFactor
Loss Factor
The manufacturer’s declared loss factor for the hot water store, if available (see Row BI). Units: kWh/day.
BR
TempFactorUnadj
Temp Factor
The unadjusted Temperature Factor. This is used to calculate storage losses from the hot water store in the absence of the manufacturer’s declared loss factor. The value depends on the type of water store and for storage combi boilers it also depends upon the volume of the hot water store. Increasing the temperature factor means a larger storage loss. The various possible values are detailed in DEAP manual Table 2.
BS
TempFactorMultiplier
Temp Factor Mult
The Temperature Factor Multiplier. This is used to account for how heating controls on the main water heating system can affect the storage losses, e.g. a cylinder thermostat is assumed to reduce storage losses by 10% giving a Temperature Factor Multiplier of 0.9. The various possible values are detailed in the notes following DEAP manual Table 2.
BT
InsulationType
HW Insulation Type
The type of insulation on the hot water store. There are two possible values: • Loose jacket • Factory insulated Factory applied insulation is better than loose (lagging) jacket insulation.
BU
InsulationThickness
HW Insulation Thickness
The thickness of insulation on the hot water store, in millimetres. The thicker the insulation the smaller the storage losses.
BV
PrimaryCircuitLoss
Primary Loss
The Primary Circuit Loss. This is the amount of energy lost transferring water from where it is heated to where it is stored, e.g. from a regular boiler to the hot water cylinder. For the regular boiler & cylinder system the primary circuit loss can be reduced by insulating the pipes and installing a cylinder thermostat. For combi boilers the primary circuit is very short and contained within the insulated casing of the boiler so the primary circuit loss is taken to be zero. Values are taken from DEAP manual Table 3 and depend on the type of system installed.
BW
CombiBoilerAddLoss
Combi Loss
Additional Losses for Combi Boilers. Allowed values: see DEAP manual Table 3a. For a combi boiler an additional loss is included to allow for the draw-off of water until an adequate water temperature is attained at the taps.
BX
ElecConsumpKeepHot
Keep-Hot Elec.
The amount of electricity consumed by the keep-hot facility of an instantaneous combi boiler (see Row BM). A keep-hot facility controlled by time clock is taken to use 600 kWh/year whereas one without time clock control is assumed to use 900 kWh/year
BY

CA
CollectorHeatLossCoEff
Coll. Heat Loss
The Collector Heat-loss Coefficient of a system of solar water heating collectors. Some of the energy absorbed by a solar collector will inevitably be lost to the surroundings. The amount of heat lost is quantified by the collector heat-loss coefficient. The higher the value, the more of the collected heat that is lost. This information is taken from the HARP database or from certified test data, if it is available. Otherwise default values from DEAP manual Table H1 are used.
CB
AnnualSolarRadiation
Solar Radiation
The Annual Solar Radiation incident on 1 m2 of solar collectors. This depends on the orientation and angle of the collectors to the horizontal. The optimal set-up is to have the collectors facing south at an angle of 30° to the horizontal though any orientation between south-east and south-west or any angle between 15° to 45° will be close to the optimum. This data must be taken from DEAP manual Table H2.
CC
OvershadingFactor
Overshading
The Overshading Factor for a system of solar water heating collectors. The calculation of the performance of a solar hot water system must take account of any obstacles that prevent sunlight from falling on the solar collectors for some or all of the day. The overshading factor fulfils this role. It has one of four values depending on the percentage of the sky blocked by obstacles when viewed from the collectors: Overshading % of sky blocked by obstacles. Overshading factor Heavy > 80% 0.5 Significant > 60% - 80% 0.65 Modest 20% - 60% 0.8 None or very little < 20% 1.0 Ideally the collectors will be situated so that there is as little shading as possible.
CD
CylinderStat
Cylinder Stat
If the cylinder is heated by a boiler, is there a Cylinder Thermostat? Allowed values: Yes, No, NA. This relates to systems where hot water is provided by a boiler and a solar hot water system. If there is no cylinder thermostat on the hot water cylinder the output of the solar hot water system is reduced by 10%. If the question does not apply the “NA” option (Not Applicable) is chosen.
CE

The Dedicated Solar Storage Volume. This is the volume of water in the storage cylinder(s) that is only heated by the solar collectors.
CF
VolumeOfPreHeatStore
n/a
(this field is not used in DEAP)
CG
CombinedCylinder
Combined Cylinder
Is the dedicated solar storage in a combined cylinder? Allowed Values: Yes or No. If the cylinder that is heated by the solar collector is also heated by other heat sources, e.g. a regular oil/gas boiler or a solid fuel stove with a back boiler, this is set to “Yes”. If the cylinder is heated only by the solar collector it is set to “No”.
CH
ElectricityConsumption
Solar pump elec
The electricity consumption of the solar circuit circulation pump. If the pump is solar powered (see next entry) this has a value of zero. Otherwise a default value of 75 kWh/year is assumed.
CI
SWHPumpSolarPowered
Solar pump power
Is the solar hot water pump solar powered? Allowed Values: Yes or No. A pump is usually installed to maintain the flow of water around the solar circuit. This pump may be solar powered in which case no electricity is required to run it. If it is not solar-powered, however, electricity is required and must be accounted for (see previous row).
CJ
ChargingBasisHeatConsumed
Charging
Group Heating Scheme: Is charging based on heat consumed? Allowed Values: Yes or No. In a group heating scheme if all houses are charged a flat fee, and no account is taken of how much energy each individual household actually uses, a factor of 0.9 is applied to the efficiency of the group heating system on the assumption that the heating will be overused.
CK
gsdHSSupplHeatFraction
Group Supp. Frac
Group Heating Scheme: Percentage of heat supplied by the Supplementary system. This is the percentage of the space heating demand provided by the secondary system in a dwelling which is part of a group heating scheme. Currently this has a value of 10%. If there is no secondary system then this quantity has a value of zero.
CL
gsdHSSupplSystemEff
Group Supp. Eff
Group Heating Scheme: Efficiency of the Supplementary system. The (gross) seasonal efficiency of the secondary space heating system, if one is present. As in dwellings with individual heating systems, a secondary space heating system is specified if: • fixed secondary heaters are present, e.g. an open fire, or, • the main heating system is insufficient to heat the dwelling to the temperatures required. The efficiency may be taken from one of three sources: • the HARP database, • a manufacturer’s value certified by an accredited testing laboratory, or, • a default value from DEAP manual Table 4a/4b. If there is no secondary system then this will have a value of zero.

The Renewables tab allows for the benefits of newer energy-saving technologies that are not included in the published DEAP software (including photovoltaics, wind energy, solar space heating amongst others). Heat pumps, biomass, heat recovery ventilation and solar water heating are all accounted for elsewhere in DEAP and are not to be included in this section. The energy produced (and consumed) by the technology is entered as delivered energy. The associated primary energy factor and CO2 emissions are taken from Table 8. Further guidance is taken in Appendix M and Appendix Q. Section 13.2 provides details on use of the Renewables tab to contribute towards the renewable energy requirement of Building Regulations 2008, 2011 and 2019 TGD L.

Small Area Code
Small Areas are a relatively recent geographic concept compiled by the National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) on behalf of the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) and in consultation with the CSO. They were designed as the lowest level of geography for the compilation of statistics in line with data protection guidelines and typically contain between 50 and 200 dwellings. A further constraint imposed when creating these new areas, was that they nested within Electoral Division boundaries. Finally, they are generally comprised either of complete townlands or neighbourhoods.

RER
Renewable Energy Ratio
Renewable Energy Ratio
TGD L 2008 and 2011 define the renewable energy requirement as an absolute figure in kWh renewable energy per m2 floor area per year, whereas TGD L 2019 defines it as a Renewable Energy Ratio (RER). DEAP automatically derives the renewable energy ratio for renewable technologies. Full visibility into the DEAP algorithms, including RER is available in the published Excel Workbook version of DEAP.
